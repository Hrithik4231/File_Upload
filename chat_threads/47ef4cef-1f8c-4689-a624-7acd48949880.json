        "content": "S Chapter 1 The Manipulator ometimes I have very dark thoughts about my mother—thoughts no sane daughter should ever have. Sometimes, I’m not always sane. “Addie, you’re being ridiculous,” Mom says through the speaker on my phone. I glare at it in response, refusing to argue with her. When I have nothing to say, she sighs loudly. I wrinkle my nose. It blows my mind that this woman always called Nana dramatic yet can’t see her own flair for the dramatics. “Just because your grandparents gave you the house doesn’t mean you have to actually live in it. It’s old and would be doing everyone in that city a favor if it were torn down.” I thump my head against the headrest, rolling my eyes upward and trying to find patience weaved into the stained roof of my car. How did I manage to get ketchup up there? “And just because you don’t like it, doesn’t mean I can’t live in it,” I retort dryly. My mother is a bitch. Plain and simple. She’s always had a chip on her shoulder, and for the life of me,"

        "content": "Parsons Manor. She could barely tolerate me, so I spent most of my childhood in this house. It wasn’t until I left for college that Mom moved out of town an hour away. When I quit college, I moved in with her until I got back on my feet and my writing career took off. And when it did, I decided to travel around the country, never really settling in one place. Nana died about a year ago, gifting me the house in her will, but my grief hindered me from moving into Parsons Manor. Until now. Mom sighs again through the phone. “I just wish you had more ambition in life, instead of staying in the town you grew up in, sweetie. Do something more with your life than waste away in that house like your grandmother did. I don’t want you to become worthless like her.” A snarl overtakes my face, fury tearing throughout my chest. “Hey, Mom?” “Yes?” “Fuck off.” I hang up the phone, angrily smashing my finger into the screen until I hear the telltale chime that the call has ended."

        "content": "to. Like I want to. I regret that decision. Currently, he has me pinned against the wall in my creepy hallway. Old fashioned sconces line the blood red walls, with dozens of family pictures from generations in between. I feel like they’re watching me, scorn and disappointment in their eyes as they witness their descendant about to get railed right in front of them. Only a few of the lights work, and they just serve to illuminate the spiderwebs they’re crawling with. The rest of the hallway is shadowed entirely, and I’m just waiting for the demon from The Grudge to come crawling out so I have an excuse to run. I would definitely trip Greyson on the way out at this point, and not one inch of me is ashamed."

He looks like an idiot—completely naked save for a single sock because the rest of his clothes are still thrown haphazardly in my hallway. He storms out of my room, snatching up articles of clothing as he goes. When he gets about halfway down the long hallway, he stops and turns to me. “You’re such a bitch, Addie. All you do is give me blue balls and I’m sick of it. I’m done with you and this creepy fucking house,” he seethes, pointing a finger at me. “And you’re an asshole. Get the fuck out of my house, Greyson.” His eyes widen with shock first, and then narrow into thin slits, brimming with fury. He turns, cocks his arm back and sends his fist flying into the drywall. A gasp is ripped from my throat when half of his arm disappears, my mouth parting in both shock and disbelief."

I really fucking enjoy hurting people, but tonight, I have no goddamn patience for this whiny asshole. And normally, I have the patience of a saint. I know how to wait for what I want most. But when I’m trying to get some real answers and the dude’s too busy shitting his pants and crying to give me a coherent response, I get a little testy. “This knife is about to go halfway through your eyeball,” I warn. “I’m not even going to show you any mercy and shove it all the way through to your brain.” “Fuck, man,” he cries. “I told you that I just went to the warehouse a few times. I don’t know anything about some fuckin’ ritual.” “So, you’re useless is what you’re saying,” I surmise, inching the blade towards his eye. He squeezes them shut as if skin that’s no thicker than a centimeter is going to prevent the knife from going through his"
